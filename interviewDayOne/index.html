        <h3>What is NodeJs</h3>
        <p class="space">Node. js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.<br>
            Node.js is cross-platform and runs on Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS, etc. Node.js is a back-end 
            JavaScript runtime environment.<br> 
            Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser 
            to the <br> server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push 
            notifications.</p>

        <h3>1. What is NPM?</h3>
        <p class="space">1. NPM stands for the node package manager, npm is used for node dependency management.</p>
        <p class="space">2. Most of the time, we use npm as a server-side node dependency tool.</p>
        <p class="space">3. NPM gets installed with NodeJs installation. NPM uses nested dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in ourcode.</p>
        <p class="space">4. Nested dependencies mean that any dependency is again dependent on another dependency npm: It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.</p>
        <p class="space">5. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. Help to manage a project’s dependencies. npm is installed with Node automatically.</p>
        <p class="space">6. npm: NPM generates a ‘package-lock.json’ file. the package-lock will generate the same node_modules folder for different npm versions.</p>

        <h3>2.What are the modules in Node.js?</h3>
        <p class="space">➔ In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.</p>
        <p class="space">➔ Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.</p>
        <p class="space">➔ The reason programmers are heavily reliant on modules is because of their re-usability as well as the ability to break down a complex piece of code into manageable chunks.</p> 
        <p class="space">Modules are of three types:</p>
        <p class="space">1. Core Modules/Internal modules </p>
        <p class="space">2. Local Modules/Custom modules</p>
        <p class="space">3. Third-party Modules</p>
        <p class="space">Core Modules: Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js installation. These modules can be loaded into<br>
            the program by using the require function. The require() function will return a JavaScript type depending on what the particular module returns.<br> 
            ex:- http creates an HTTP server in Node.js.</p>
        <p class="space">Local Modules: Unlike built-in and external modules, local modules are created locally in your Node.js application. Let’s create a simple calculating</br> 
            module that calculates various operations. Another file can use its exported functionality using the require() function.</p>
        <p class="space">Third-party modules: Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package Manager(NPM). These modules can be installed<br>
            in the project folder or globally. Some of the popular third-party modules are mongoose, express, angular, and react.</p>
        <p class="space">Example: npm install express</p>

        <h3>3.What is the purpose of the module.exports?</h3>
        <p class="space">➔ Module.exports is the instruction that tells Node. js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to “export” from a given file so<br>
              other files are allowed to access the exported code.</p>
        <p class="space">➔ The module.exports is actually a property of the module object in node.js module. Exports is the object that is returned to the require() call.</p>
        <p class="space">➔ By module.exports, we can export functions, objects, and their references from one file and can use them in other files by importing them by<br>
            require() method. easy to maintain and manage the code base in different modules.</p>

        <h3>4.Difference between default export and named export.</h3>
        <p class="space">Export objects, functions, variables from the module so they can be used by other programs with the help of the import statements. </p>
        <p class="space">There are two types of exports.</p>
        <p class="space">1. Named Exports, </p>
        <p class="space">2. Default Exports. </p>
        <p class="space">Named Exports: Named exports are useful to export several values. During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.</p>
        <p class="space">Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a single file and were introduced with the release of ES2015.</p>
        <p class="space">Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must be imported using the name of the object, function or variable that was exported.</p>

        <p class="space">//Exporting individual features: </p>
        <p class="space">export var name1 = …, name2 = …, …, nameN; // also let, const</p> 

        <p class="space">// Export list : </p>
        <p class="space">export { name1, name2, nameN };</p> 

        <p class="space">//Exporting everything at once :</p>
        <p class="space">export { object, number, x, y, boolean, string }</p> 

        <p class="space">// Renaming exports: </p>
        <p class="space"> export { variable1 as name1, variable2 as name2, …, nameN };</p>
        <p class="space">// export features declared earlier:</p>
        <p class="space">export { myFunction, myVariable };</p><br>
        <p class="space">Default Exports: Default exports are useful to export only a single object, function, variable. During the import, we can use any name to import.Exports<br>
            without a default tag are Named exports. Exports with the default tag are Default exports.</p>
        <p class="space">default export:- Using Named and Default Exports at the same time: It is possible to use Named and Default exports in the same file.<br>
            It means both will be imported in the same file. Example: javascript. </p>
        <p class="space">function defau(req,res){
            res.send("default exports")
            } </p>
        <p class="space">function named(req,res) {
            res.send('named exports')
            } </p>
        <p class="space">module.exports = default; //default export </p>
        <p class="space">module.exports = {named}; //named export </p>
        
        <h3>5. How do you import any module in Node.js?</h3> 
        <p class="space">Importing functions or modules enhances the reusability of code. <br>
            Importing a Module: We need to import the module to use the functions defined in 
            the imported module in another file. The result returned by require() is stored in a 
            variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation. </p>
        <p class="space">const f = require('./func')</p>
